# LiveDocs

This project is from a YouTube tutorial (JavaScript Mastery) about a Google Docs-like software that manages collaborators in real time, featuring an authentication flow, a full markdown editor, complete document management to create, edit, save, and delete documents, real-time nested comments with tagging, emojis, and complete CRUD functionalities for discussions, floating comments, live cursors showing collaborators' locations, instant notifications, flexible sharing options like inviting or revoking editors/viewers, and a fully responsive native-like design.

I used NextJS with server-side rendering, nested layouts, server actions, and revalidation; TypeScript for type-safe code; Lexical, a powerful editor developed by Meta; ShadCN and TailwindCSS for the UI; Clerk for authentication; and Sentry for performance analysis. It's deployed on Vercel.
